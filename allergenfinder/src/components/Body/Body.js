            Taking stock: Review of emergency funding targeted at the Black and Minority Ethnic Voluntary Sector
 
 Executive summary 
  
 In response to the underfunding of Black and Ethnic Minority communities and in light of difficulties brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic, The Funders for Race Equality Alliance commissioned a UK-wide analysis of funding during the early stages of the pandemic to help funders:
 Identify their next steps in supporting the Black and Minority Ethnic voluntary sector 
 Review and analyse their funding processes  
 Enable more focused conversations about future funding strategies as the impact of the pandemic continues
 Identify infrastructure groups and networks which will enable them to reach communities they have not previously been in contact with 
 Identify gaps in where funding is going 
 Support the sustainability of the Black and Minority Ethnic sector as well as advance the anti-racism agenda 
 Understand the causes, consequences and impact of the unexpected shift in funding race equality 
 
 
 Despite the sector being under unprecedented pressure we were able to receive feedback from ** funders. And we were fortunate to receive direction from key players in the charity sector including The Ubele Initiative, Futures First UK and 360Giving.
 Challenges:
 Black and Minority Ethnic charities say that little is changing. Quote Many studies have been conducted in recent years and strong voices have emerged to highlight systematic challenges in funding, yet sustained changes have yet to be made. 
 The challenges of grassroots organisations are not being addressed by funding. Not enough money is going towards core costs and sustaining small organisations. 
 There is no cohesive approach to solving the problem. Many funders and grassroot organisations are talking about the right issues, but a collective and directed approach is needed for sustainable change. 
 The charity sector needs more accountability. Until funders are clearly able to align their outcomes with their goals they will not be able to assess their effectiveness.
 Actions for funders:
 The collection of ethnicity data should be mandatory and without it the funding sector will struggle to maintain true accountability
 Use intermediary organisations that have an established link with grassroot organisations to make sure that funding is reaching charities
 Increasing core costs to fund small organisations that struggle to stay afloat. Charities should not have to rely upon volunteers. 
 Increase direct contact with grassroots charities to understand their challenges. Decision makers should have a better understanding of the impact their decisions will have. 
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 Foreword
  
 During 2020 the world was hit with the Covid-19 pandemic and it was quickly understood that the impact of the virus in the UK would be deep and widely felt. In the coming weeks a picture began emerging of the disproportionate impact of the virus upon racialised communities. 
  
 In April 2020 The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre found that 35% of almost 2,000 patients were non-white, nearly triple the 13% proportion in the UK population as a whole1. An analysis by The Institute of Fiscal Studies at the time showed that the rate of deaths from Covid-19 in British Black Africans was over 2.5 times that of the White population. And deaths in those of Indian and Pakistani backgrounds were respectively 53 and 30 per 100’000 compared to 27 per 100’000 in those from White British backgrounds.
  
 Amongst other factors, lower socioeconomic backgrounds and an overrepresentation in frontline jobs increased their exposure to the virus. 
  
 A third of all working-age people from Black African backgrounds are employed in key worker roles and Black African, Pakistani and Indian men are much more likely to work in healthcare than White British men 2. By 23 April, official figures showed that 111 health and social care workers had died from the virus, and an analysis by Sky News found that 72 percent of these were from BAME communities3.
  
 In spring 2020, the killing of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the USA amongst other highly visible incidents of police violence and brutality sparked a wave of protests and marches worldwide. The Black Lives Matter movement helped expose the disproportionate effect of these issues upon Black and Minority Ethnic communities and led to a shift in the funding of race equality in the UK. 
  
 The emergency of the Covid-19 pandemic was like no other emergency we as a nation have experienced. Therefore we cannot expect that funders would have all the proficiency to be able to traverse it. Gathering accurate data and analysing funders' responses helps to build examples from which we can develop in an area where benchmarks do not exist. 
  
 The Funders for Race Equality Alliance has commissioned a snapshot analysis of how emergency funds were brought together and distributed to Black and Minority Ethnic communities between March and November 2020. 
  
 As the pandemic continues, it is likely its effects will be felt for the best part of the next decade. The charity sector has a unique opportunity to learn from a challenging situation which has laid bare the injustices and inequalities in our communities. It is a unique opportunity to change long practised policies and develop recipient led and data driven strategies.
  
  
  
 Introduction
  
 This report is an analysis of funding made available to the Black and Minority Ethnic voluntary sector between March and November 2020 and will offer recommendations for how funders can continue to support communities most impacted by the dual pandemics of structural racism and Covid-19.
  
 It sits alongside existing work The Alliance has commissioned: a mapping of the race equality sector in England and an audit tool to identify how much of members’ funding is going towards Black and Minority Ethnic led organisations and contributing to race equality outcomes. It aims to provide a snapshot of the emergency funding available between March and November 2020. 
 This analysis of funding towards the Black and Minority Ethnic voluntary sector cannot be seen in isolation. Instead, acknowledging the historical lack of funding for the race equality sector draws attention to the multiple pressures on an already overburdened sector.
  
 In April 2020, The Ubele Initiative, a leading infrastructure body for the Black, Minority Ethnic voluntary sector highlighted the impact of the pandemic on services for the Black and Minority Ethnic community4. 
  
 These included: 
 Historic underfunding of Black and Minority Ethnic organisations
 The result of reduced staff due to self-isolation
 Developing new ways of working
 A lack of reserve funds to help with adaptation
 New issues arising within communities on account of the pandemic - such as an increase in mental health issues and domestic violence.
  
 From ring-fenced and targeted funding pots to flexibility in the use of grants, funders have made a conscious effort to reassess their culture, workforce and funding approaches. The latter has changed the funding landscape rapidly and unexpectedly. As a result, this analysis aims to further understand the nature and scale of funding that has been allocated to race equality, following the impacts of Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement. 
  
  
  
  
 Overview of Emergency Funding
 Methodology
 Our analysis reported on 33 funds with a total value of *** of which £47M went to Black and Minority Ethnic organisations. These were ‘Funds’ rather than individual grants allowing us to dive deeper into their aims and criteria to understand the sector's response more clearly. We understand that there were also targeted grants by individual funders available during this time, such as The Indigo Trust. These were not included as part of the analysis but we recognise that they would have also provided support. 
 We compiled our original list of suitable funds from online searches and recommendations from partner organisations including The Ubele Initiative, Futures First and 360Giving. Data was collected from publicly available sources and invaluable contributions from funders. Through selected criteria we were able to conduct a quantitative analysis of the way in which funders were working in these emergency conditions. We used directed questions at the end of the analysis to provide context and depth to the decisions made by individual funders during this period.
 Most funding was not available until the middle to the latter part of the year. Charities Aid Foundation were able to deploy emergency funds by March, but did not collect detailed recipient data and therefore could not be included in the study. 
 Some funds were excluded from the analysis because they did not fit within the time criteria this analysis looked at but still came from the same ethos of social change. These included : the Majonzi Fund, Children in Need Black Lives, The Cowrie Scholarship Fund and The Global Majority fund which will distribute funding in the coming months and shows that invaluable work is still continuing.
 Quantitative Analysis
 Our data is key to our analysis and shows the trends in the way in which funders were working during this emergency period. 
 * Chart data is correct to 25th Jan, but all aesthetics will be carried out by the design team
 How were Funds constructed
 
 The construction of Funds was divided into three categories: Pooled, Aligned and Individual. 
 Pooled funds: Funders collaborating by combining funds, resources and knowledge to distribute funds under a single criteria. 
 Individual fund: An individual organisation defining its own fund criteria and distributing funds itself.
 Aligned fund: funders coming together under the same funding criteria and goals, but with funds being distributed by the organisations themselves rather than pooling the funds together.
 The analysis showed that the most funding came from Pooled funds. However, The London Community Response Fund which was the only Aligned fund in the analysis made up an almost equal amount of funding. Significantly all of that fund, which made up ⅖ of the entire funding analysed, went to London. Funding from Individual Funds made up a fifth of overall funding. 
 Data from The Ubele Initiative highlighted the need for greater collaboration across sectors and this can be seen in the predominance of Pooled funding in the analysis.
 Barrow Cadbury found that they had the expertise to deliver funding that TNLCF had been given from DCMS. This was part of The TNLCF Covid support fund where £1.8M was distributed to the Migrant sector.
  
 How were grantees targeted
 
 The way in which grantees were targeted was divided into four categories: Ring-fenced, Intermediaries/Regranting, Distributed (inclusive) and Distributed( direct target BAME)
 Ring-fenced funds: Specific percentage or amount of the total funding available set aside for the target audience.
 Intermediaries/Regranting: Funds are granted to partner organisations to distribute to end recipient organisations, maintaining the funds criteria.
 Distributed(direct target BAME): No specific amount or percentage of the fund is allocated, but the audience is directly targeted and encouraged to apply for funding. It may include prioritisation, additional help or direct referral. 
 Distributed (inclusive): No specific amount or percentage of the fund is allocated, but the audience is targeted through general advertising and encouraged to apply.
 Historically Black and Minority Ethnic organisations have had disproportionately lower access to statutory funding, issues which were highlighted by Voice4Change England in their 2015 survey (Funding for Black, Asian & other minority ethnic communities). It revealed that one third of applications by BAME applicants were mostly unsuccessful and another third were partially unsuccessful, even though these organisations are often the ones with the highest lived experience of the communities that they serve. It also found that the average income of a Black and Minority Ethinic charity was £78’960 compared to the overall average of £142’439.
 “Many have existed on often small local authority grants while delivering effective under-the-radar impact that far outstrips their income. Some purposely remained small to avoid the bureaucracy of grant-bidding while others grew and ‘professionalised’” *
  
 And in early 2020 #CharitySoWhite coordinated an open letter to the government5 asking them to ensure that 20% of funding is ring-fenced for Black and Minority 
 Comic Relief’s Change Makers programme will be the first time it will ring-fence funding for people from a Black, Asian or minority ethnic background. On this issue Dilhani Wijeyesekera said “We .. want to signal the importance of this issue at this time.”  *
 In our analysis group 20% of funds were ring-fenced, with some organisations such as Lloyds benchmarking ring-fenced funding at 20% but managing to deliver 38%. 
 The largest portion of funding was distributed through targeted programmes, where additional steps were being used to ensure that funding was reaching the right recipients. One such funder was Rosa UK who had one fund exclusively targeting organisations led-by and for Black and Minoritized women and specifically targeting known grantees that met their criteria. In their other funding, help with applications was given to try and remove structural barriers. Processes such as these have enabled 40% of all the organisations that Rosa UK has ever funded to be led-by and for Black and Minoritised women.
  
 How Could Funds be spent
 
 The way in which grantees could be spent was divided into three categories: Restricted, Unrestricted and Flexible.
 Restricted: Funds that can only be spent on specific priorities
 Unrestricted: Core funds with no restrictions
 Flexible: Restricted funds with flexibility for core costs due to COVID
 Historically, emergency funding has been specific to a cause or a reaction to a need and the Covid crisis was no different from this. But while the funding provided was in essence of emergency there was an underlying need for it to develop into sustained change. 
 Over half of all funds were flexible; assigned to a particular priority or use but with flexibility on what it could be spent on and only 12% of funds were restricted. 
 This was a reaction to the emergency nature of the funding and the understanding that this crisis brought wide ranging issues and VSO’s needed the flexibility to react to this. Several funders highlighted their intention to increase support to current grantees and loosen the restrictions around funding that had already been given so they could be repurposed for other uses. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 What type of projects did funding go to
 
 Funders were asked to indicate the type of projects that grants would be used on. The choices included: Culture, Heritage and Arts, Sport, Education, Children, Young and Family, Older people, Gender, Work and occupation, Climate change, Poverty, Human Rights and Justice, Homelessness, Community engagement, Crisis services, Immigration, Health, Adaptation and Disability, further explanation is available here. These groups were not mutually exclusive. 
 Poverty, Health, Children & Family, Community Engagement and Adaptation were the top five areas to be funded. These areas covered food banks, NRPF, areas of deprivation, mental health and wellbeing, grassroots community work and changes necessary for organisations to continue working during the pandemic.
 Some funds such as Barrow Cadbury’s COVID support fund, Migration Exchanges’s COVID-19 Respond and Adapt Programme and Resourcing Racial Justice’s Resourcing Racial Justice Fund were specifically directed to immigration but in the current climate funded projects in almost every area (all grants had an underlying migration theme).
 This was also true for gender based funders such as Rosa UK and Smallwood who funded projects in numerous areas as the needs of their grantees widened due to the pandemic, although their overarching premise was still to help women. 
 BNSSG CCG’s Community Mental Health Grants, similar to Sport England specifically targeted health and wellbeing.
 It was evident that those working in specific domains such as immirgration, gender or health continued working in those areas while diversifying their funds. While other funders were attempting to address wider ranging community issues created by the pandemic. These included funders such as UnLtd, Lloyds, Do It Now Now and Power to Change who all emphasised the need for Black, Minority Ethnic led VSO run projects.
  
 How was funding distributed across the 4 nations
 
 Where funding could be spent was divided into the four Nations: England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. 
 
 All funding pots were either for the UK or England with the exception of one fund that was allocated to England and Wales. 
 70% of funding went to England only and 22% to the UK. No funds from those which we analysed were specifically for Scotland or Northern Ireland. 
 
 End recipient data was not available for all the funds that we analysed. Where grantee data was available we conducted a deeper analysis by UK Region. For this part of the analysis we were able to include 15 funds of the 33 analysed. This made up £35.6M of the total £47M of funds included in the analysis. 
 
 
 
 
 The majority of funding, 70% went to London. This was followed by The North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, The West Midlands and The East Midlands who all received around 5% each. Northern Ireland and Wales received the least at around 0.5% each. 
 The distribution clearly shows that London overwhelmingly received the largest portion of available funds, of which The London Funders made up almost 80%.
 To understand an aspect of how well funds were distributed across the UK we can compare Black and Minority ethinc populations by UK Regions with the amount of funding they received. As of the last census in 2011, 13% of the UK population identified at Black and Minority Ethnic. That is equivalent to around 8.1M people.

 Going Forward
  
 Funders said that this process had introduced them to new VCSE’s and created relationships that didn’t exist before. This included partnerships with other funders for delivery and stepping into new areas. They have also learned, such as in the case of Power to Change, that issues of deprivation and intersectionality needed a more thoughtful response and there are different ways of reaching target audiences. 
  
 Learning from their experiences, funders were still reluctant to advise where they felt the biggest needs were in this sector. They recognised that they still had a lot to learn in this space and wanted to be driven by the BAME community in this learning. PWC felt that increased funding was needed outside London, something that is reflected in the distribution of funding in the analysis. And that working together would help to better pool resources and prevent replication, some of which has been seen during this period. UnLtd believe that the pathway to social investment, procurement and support for BAME organisations needs to be addressed in its entirety to enable them to become truly self-sufficient
  
 Going forward, some funders are taking time to assess the way they work and map their path forward, keen to use their experiences during this time to shape their work. Barrow Cadbury wants to contribute to capacity building and leadership development and The PwC Foundation are aiming to increase and extend their support over the next 5 years. Power to Change is undergoing more fundamental changes and restructuring to help smaller organisations to find a sustainable way out of the pandemic.
 Funders said that their focus on Black and Ethnic Minority funding was impacted by current events including the Black Lives Matter movement and data on underfunding in this area. Several were already working in this area but the events of the summer and Covid accelerated their response and as with UnLtd increased the benchmarks that they aimed for. 
  
  
  
 (Main observations)
 Recognition of historical underfunding
 Awareness of disproportionate disadvantage in Black and Minority communities
 Focus on lived experience and Black and Ethnic Minority led organisations
 Focus on flexible funding and repurposed funds
 Collaboration and pooling of funds
 Funders with funding priorities in other areas diversified to address the current issues
 Of the funders we analysed, tackling issues of race was a prominent theme of Covid emergency funding. Several funders, cited research by The Ubele Initiative and referenced recent events linked to the BLM movement. Application criterias included priority to BAME led-by and for organisations and also spoke of the value of lived experience.
  
  
  
  
  
 Conclusion  (draft, more will be added)
 To fully understand the effectiveness of funders response to this emergency we would need to understand how the BAME sector is normally funded. Without clear benchmarks or collective strategies in place for long term support it is hard to equate just how effective the response was. 
 Pre-2020 few organisations seem to have had a clear strategy in place and fewer still had any type of ring-fenced funding. The sector's response was therefore one of that to an emergency and they now seem to be looking for direction in moving forward.
 
 Recommendations
 Make all names full
  agree. I think it’s also important to consider some of the recommendations from the V4CE 2015 report when it comes to the Discussion/Recommendations/ Conclusion part of this report (eg 6 years ago funders didn’t act on the recommendations to support the BAME sector – so how do we act now to stop things going back to the same poor practice once the Covid-19 emergency is over?).

 Limitations 
 The analysis is limited to the funds that we were aware of and for which we could verify the data. It is also limited by our understanding of the criteria for each fund.
